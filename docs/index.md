# Enterprise File Storage System Documentation

## Overview

The Enterprise File Storage System (EFSS) is a scalable, cloud-agnostic solution for managing large-scale file operations across multiple cloud providers. This system supports seamless integration with both Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Amazon S3, providing redundancy and flexibility for enterprise-level storage needs.

## Key Features

- Multi-cloud support (GCS and AWS S3)
- Automatic failover and redundancy
- Content-aware deduplication
- Intelligent caching layer
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- End-to-end encryption
- Automatic version control

## Architecture

The system implements a layered architecture:

1. Application Layer
2. Storage Abstraction Layer
3. Provider-specific Adapters
4. Physical Storage Layer

### Storage Abstraction Layer

The storage abstraction layer provides a unified interface for interacting with different cloud storage providers. This ensures that your application code remains clean and provider-agnostic.

## Code Examples

### Google Cloud Storage Implementation

```python
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
class GCSStorageHandler:
def init(self, bucket_name):
self.client = storage.Client()
self.bucket = self.client.bucket(bucket_name)
def upload_file(self, source_file_path, destination_blob_name):
blob = self.bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)
blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_path)
# Generate signed URL for temporary access
url = blob.generate_signed_url(
version="v4",
expiration=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15),
method="GET"
)
return url
def download_file(self, source_blob_name, destination_file_path):
blob = self.bucket.blob(source_blob_name)
blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_path)
```

### AWS S3 Implementation

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

class S3StorageHandler:
    def __init__(self, bucket_name):
        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
        self.bucket_name = bucket_name
    
    def upload_file(self, file_path, object_name):
        try:
            self.s3_client.upload_file(
                file_path,
                self.bucket_name,
                object_name,
                ExtraArgs={'ServerSideEncryption': 'AES256'}
            )
            return True
        except ClientError as e:
            return False
    
    def generate_presigned_url(self, object_name, expiration=3600):
        try:
            url = self.s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
                'get_object',
                Params={
                    'Bucket': self.bucket_name,
                    'Key': object_name
                },
                ExpiresIn=expiration
            )
            return url
        except ClientError as e:
            return None
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

The system implements a multi-tiered caching strategy:

1. In-memory cache for frequently accessed metadata
2. Local disk cache for recently accessed files
3. Regional edge caches for improved global performance

The caching system uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm with the following default configurations:

- Memory cache: 1GB
- Disk cache: 100GB per node
- Edge cache: 1TB per region

### Deduplication

File deduplication is performed using a combination of:

- SHA-256 content hashing
- Variable-sized chunking
- Content-defined chunking (CDC)

This approach typically achieves a 60-80% reduction in storage requirements for enterprise deployments.

## Security

### Encryption

All data is encrypted using:

- In-transit: TLS 1.3
- At-rest: AES-256
- Key management: AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS

### Access Control

RBAC is implemented using a hierarchical model:

- Organization level
- Project level
- Folder level
- File level

## Disaster Recovery

The system maintains:

- Cross-region replication
- Point-in-time recovery (up to 30 days)
- 99.999% availability SLA
- Automatic failover within 30 seconds

## Best Practices

1. Always use the provided SDK instead of direct API calls
2. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Use appropriate file naming conventions
4. Monitor storage metrics and set up alerts
5. Regularly review and rotate access credentials

## Monitoring and Logging

The system provides comprehensive monitoring through:

- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- ELK stack integration
- Custom alerting rules

## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the following limits are enforced:

| Operation | Rate Limit |
|-----------|------------|
| Upload    | 1000 req/min |
| Download  | 5000 req/min |
| Delete    | 100 req/min |
| List      | 500 req/min |

## Support and Maintenance

Regular maintenance windows are scheduled for:

- Security patches: Weekly
- Feature updates: Monthly
- Major version updates: Quarterly

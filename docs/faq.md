# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Enterprise File Storage System (EFSS)?
EFSS is a scalable, cloud-agnostic solution that manages large-scale file operations across multiple cloud providers, primarily Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Amazon S3.

### Which cloud providers are supported?
Currently, EFSS supports Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Amazon S3, providing redundancy and flexibility across both platforms.

### What are the key features of EFSS?
- Multi-cloud support
- Automatic failover and redundancy
- Content-aware deduplication
- Intelligent caching
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- End-to-end encryption
- Automatic version control

## Technical Questions

### What are the rate limits for different operations?
| Operation | Rate Limit |
|-----------|------------|
| Upload    | 1000 req/min |
| Download  | 5000 req/min |
| Delete    | 100 req/min |
| List      | 500 req/min |

### How does the caching system work?
EFSS uses a multi-tiered caching strategy with:
- In-memory cache: 1GB
- Disk cache: 100GB per node
- Edge cache: 1TB per region
The system implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm for cache management.

### How is data encrypted?
Data is encrypted using:
- TLS 1.3 for in-transit encryption
- AES-256 for at-rest encryption
- AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS for key management

### What is the system's availability SLA?
EFSS maintains a 99.999% availability SLA with automatic failover within 30 seconds.

## Storage and Performance

### How does deduplication work?
The system uses three methods for deduplication:
- SHA-256 content hashing
- Variable-sized chunking
- Content-defined chunking (CDC)
This typically results in 60-80% storage reduction for enterprise deployments.

### How long is data retained for disaster recovery?
The system supports point-in-time recovery for up to 30 days and implements cross-region replication for disaster recovery.

## Security and Access

### How is access control managed?
RBAC is implemented hierarchically at four levels:
- Organization level
- Project level
- Folder level
- File level

### What monitoring capabilities are available?
The system provides monitoring through:
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- ELK stack integration
- Custom alerting rules

## Maintenance and Support

### How often are updates performed?
- Security patches: Weekly
- Feature updates: Monthly
- Major version updates: Quarterly

### How can I get support?
For technical support, contact: support@efss-example.com

### What are the best practices for using EFSS?
1. Always use the provided SDK instead of direct API calls
2. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Use appropriate file naming conventions
4. Monitor storage metrics and set up alerts
5. Regularly review and rotate access credentials
